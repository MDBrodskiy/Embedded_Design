\begin{itemize}

  \item Advantages of multiple files

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Reduce redundant work

      \item Improve portability

      \item Enhance performance

      \item Partition work for collaboration

      \item Save compilation time

    \end{itemize}

  \item A header file is a file with extension \texttt{.h}

  \item Contains C/C++ definitions and functions

  \item Header files can contain:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item All the constants

        \begin{center}
          \texttt{static const double PI = 3.14159}
        \end{center}

      \item Macros

        \begin{center}
          \texttt{\#define PI 3.14159}
        \end{center}

      \item Function prototypes

        \begin{center}
          \texttt{void PrintMyStack()}
        \end{center}

      \item \texttt{struct} data structures definition

      \item System-wide global variables

    \end{itemize}

  \item For a header file, it would be included using:

    \begin{center}
      \texttt{\#include ``<FILENAME>''}
    \end{center}

  \item We will later convert code from a single cpp file to headers and source files

\end{itemize}
