\begin{itemize}

  \item Headers are included at the top, and are denoted by \code{\#include}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item We will almost always be defining a header for \code{cin} and \code{cout} (for input and output)

    \end{itemize}

  \item After you write a C++ program, you compile it; that is, you run a program called a compiler that checks whether the program follows the C++ syntax

    \begin{itemize}

      \item If it finds errors, it lists them

      \item If there are no errors, it translates the C++ program into machine language which can be executed

    \end{itemize}

  \item Single-line comments begin with //

  \item Indentation is for the convenience of the reader

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The compiler ignores white space

    \end{itemize}

  \item Input statements would begin with \code{cin >> a}, where \code{a} would be some kind of input, like a variable

  \item Output statements begin with \code{cout << a}, where \code{a} would be some kind of output, like a String of text

  \item Functions

    \begin{itemize}

      \item C++ functions are specialized blocks

      \item Each one begins with a return type, function name, and input parameters, in the following format:

        \begin{center}
          \code{<return type> <name>(<params>) \{ \}}
        \end{center}

      \item All functions should be declared before main

      \item Function names are generally camel-case (starts with lowercase, and every subsequent word is capitalized)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Always put comments in the code

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Start with a multi-line comment with author information
        
      \item Multi-line comments are denoted with \code{/*} and \code{*/}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Arrays and Pointers

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A pointer is merely an address of where a datum or structure is stored

        \begin{itemize}

          \item All pointers are typed based on the type of entity that they point to

          \item To declare a pointer, use * preceding the variables name, ex: \code{int *x;}

        \end{itemize}
        
      \item To set a pointer to a variable's address, use \& before the variable, as in \code{x= \&y;}

        \begin{itemize}

          \item \& means ``return the memory address of''

          \item In this example, \code{x} will now point to \code{y}; that is, \code{x} stores \code{y}'s address

        \end{itemize}

      \item If you access \code{x}, you merely get the address

      \item To get the value that \code{x} points to, use *, as in \code{*x}

        \begin{itemize}

          \item \code{*x = *x + 1;} will add one to \code{y}

        \end{itemize}

      \item * is known as the indirection (or dereferencing) operator because it requires a second address

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
