\begin{itemize}

  \item The Half Adder

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Specification

        \begin{itemize}

          \item 2 Inputs ($X$, $Y$)

          \item 2 Outputs ($C$, $S$)

        \end{itemize}

        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}[h!]{c c | c  c}
            $X$ & $Y$ & $C$ & $S$\\
            \hline
            0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
            0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
            1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
            1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Full Adder

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A combinational circuit that adds 3 input bits to generate a sum bit and a carry bit (``half adder with carry in'')

      \item Specification:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Three Inputs ($X$, $Y$, $Z$)

          \item Two Outputs ($S$, $C$)

        \end{itemize}

        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}[h!]{c c c | c c}
            $X$ & $Y$ & $Z$ & $C$ & $S$\\
            \hline
             0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
             0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
             0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
             0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
             1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ 
             1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
             1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 
             1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Implementations of Multi-bit Adders:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Ripple Carry Adder

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The carry ripples from one column to the next, and then from one stage to the next

          \item Composed of $n$ 1-bit full adders

          \item Carries ripple from LSB stage to MSB stage

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Delay: $n\cdot$ (delay of single FA stage)

              \item Area required is linear in $n$

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Composed of 4 1-bit Full Adders

        \end{itemize}

      \item Assume gate delay $=T$ nanoseconds

      \item 8$T$ to compute the last carry

      \item Total delay $=8+1=9T$

      \item $1$ delay from first half adder

    \end{itemize}

  \item An adder/subtractor is built using full adders and XOR gates

  \item Binary Multiplication

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Multiplication is achieved by adding a list of shifted multiplicands according to the digits of the multiplier

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
