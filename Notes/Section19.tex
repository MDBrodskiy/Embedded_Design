\begin{itemize}

  \item Object-oriented programming (OOP) is more natural to describe the interactions between ``things'' (\textit{i}.\textit{e}. objects)

  \item OOP provides better code reuse

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Commonalities among objects described by a class
        
      \item Commonalities among classes described by a base class (inheritance)
        
    \end{itemize}

  \item Objects know what to do using their attributes: Each object responds differently to ``What is your name?''

  \item OOP provides encapsulation: hide data that do not have to be visible to the other objects or protect data from unintentional, inconsistent changes

  \item Objects Definition

    \begin{itemize}

      \item An object can be a ``concrete and tangible'' entity that can be separated with unique properties

      \item An object can be abstract and does not have to be tangible

    \end{itemize}

  \item Objects' Three Properties

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The \code{Each} object is unique and can be identified (object's name) using name, serial number, relationship with another object, etc.

      \item Each object has a set of attributes (data members), such as location, speed, size, address, phone number, on/off, etc.

      \item Each object has unique behaviors (functions/methods), such as ring (phone), accelerate and move (car), take picture (camera), etc.

    \end{itemize}

  \item Class Definition — Access Control

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Information hiding — Encapsulation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item To prevent the internal representation from direct access from outside the class

        \end{itemize}

      \item Access Specifier Keywords

        \begin{itemize}

          \item \code{public}

            \begin{itemize}

              \item May be accessible from anywhere within the program

            \end{itemize}

          \item \code{private}

            \begin{itemize}

              \item May be accessed only by the member functions, and friends of this class, not open for non-member functions

            \end{itemize}

          \item \code{protected}

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Acts as public for derived classes (child)

              \item Behaves as private for the rest of the program

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Difference between classes and structs in C++

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The default access specifier is private in classes

          \item The default access specifier is public in structs

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
