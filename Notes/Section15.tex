\begin{itemize}

  \item Traffic Light Controller

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Traffic sensors ($T_A,T_B$) are true when there is traffic

      \item The lights are denoted as $L_A,L_B$

      \item Create an FSM ``Black Box'' with only inputs and outputs

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Inputs: Clock, Reset, $T_A$, $T_B$

          \item Outputs: $L_A$, $L_B$

        \end{itemize}

      \item FSM State Transition Diagram

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Moore FSM: Outputs labeled in each state

          \item States: Circles

          \item Transitions: Arcs

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Three-Cycles High Laser Timer

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Four states

      \item Wait in ``off'' state while b is 0 ($b'$)

      \item When b is 1 (and rising clock edge), transition to On1

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Sets x to 1

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Vending Machine

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Releases item after 15 cents are deposited

      \item Single coin slot for dimes, nickels

      \item No change

      \item Suitable Abstract representation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Tabulate typical input sequence

            \begin{itemize}

              \item 3 nickels

              \item nickel, dime

              \item dime, nickel

              \item two dimes

            \end{itemize}

          \item Draw state diagram

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Inputs: $N,D$, reset

              \item Output Open chute

            \end{itemize}

          \item Assumptions

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Assume N and D asserted for one cycle

              \item Each state has a self loop for $N=D=0$ (no coin)

            \end{itemize}

          \item To minimize number of states, reuse states when possible

          \item Also, always uniquely encode states

          \item Then use K-Maps to map to logic

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item In summary, keep track of inputs and outputs, minimize number of states through reuse, and use K-Maps to map logic

\end{itemize}
