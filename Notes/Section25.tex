\begin{itemize}

  \item The final exam will be held on Tuesday at 8:00 am

  \item If two negative numbers in twos-compliment are added, there will be an overflow (should be stated)

  \item Practice problems will be posted online

  \item There will be a minterm/maxterm problem

  \item There will be a design problem, with truth tables, multiplexers, and decoders

  \item Multiplexers generally take the form of $2^{n-1}:1$

  \item Two use two smaller decoders, rather than a single larger decoder, 'not' one of the inputs, and make it the input of one of the decoders, while the input to the other decoder is just the regular input

    \begin{itemize}

      \item More specifically, given inputs $P,Q,R,S$, one could pass $P$ and $\bar{P}$ to the encoders, with the other inputs as normal

    \end{itemize}

  \item There will be some kind of class hierarchy question

\end{itemize}
