\begin{itemize}

  \item A multiplexer has:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $N$ control inputs

      \item $2^N$ data inputs

      \item 1 output

    \end{itemize}

  \item A multiplexer routes (or connects) the selected data input to the output

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The value of the control inputs determines the data input that is selected

    \end{itemize}

  \item Example:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Design a 4-to-1 multiplexer using 2-to-1 multiplexers only

      \item Essentially, ``stack'' three 2-to-1 multiplexers 

    \end{itemize}
