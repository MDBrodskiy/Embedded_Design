\begin{itemize}

  \item A computer system embedded into another system

    \begin{itemize} 

      \item Constraints from external input/output 

      \item Application-specific

        \begin{itemize} 

          \item Diverse set of application areas

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Abstraction

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Productivity enhancer â€” don't need to worry about details\ldots

        \begin{itemize}

          \item A car can be driven without the knowledge of how an internal combustion engine works

        \end{itemize}

      \item \ldots until something goes wrong

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Where's the dipstick? What's a spark plug? Am I out of gas?

        \end{itemize}

      \item Important to understand the components and how they work together

    \end{itemize}

  \item Hardware vs. Software

    \begin{itemize}

      \item All computers, given enough time and memory, are capable of computing the same exact things

      \item In theory, computers ``compute'' anything that's possible to compute

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Given enough memory and time

        \end{itemize}

      \item In practice, ``solving problems'' involves computing under constraints

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Time

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Weather forecast, next frame animation, \ldots

            \end{itemize}

          \item Cost

            \begin{itemize}

              \item iPod, automotive engine controller, \ldots

            \end{itemize}

          \item Power

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Smartphone, tablet, \ldots

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Layers of Abstraction

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Problem Statement

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Stated using ``natural language''

          \item May be ambiguous, imprecise

        \end{itemize}

      \item Algorithm

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Step-by-step procedure, recipe, guaranteed to finish

          \item Definiteness, effective computability, finiteness

        \end{itemize}

      \item Program

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Express the algorithm using a computer language

          \item High-level language, low-level language

        \end{itemize}

      \item Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Specifies the set of instructions the computer can perform

          \item Data types, addressing mode, hardware/software interface

        \end{itemize}

      \item Microarchitecture

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Detailed organization of a processor implementation

          \item Different implementations of a single ISA

        \end{itemize}

      \item Logic Circuits

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Combine basic operations to realize microarchitecture

        \end{itemize}

      \item Problem to algorithm is solved by software design, algorithm to program through programming, and program to instruction set architecture through compilation/interpretation

      \item Instruction set architecture to microarchitecture is solved through processor design, microarchitecture to a circuit is solved through logic/circuit design, and a circuit to a device is solved through the engineering process and fabrication

    \end{itemize}
